Possible Contraints

- Session (35' working time) - Pen & Paper: Developers write and simulate all code without a computer. Very useful for understanding the problem domain.
  Session
- Test List (15'): Try to find a bunch of good tests, you can start with, before actually starting.
- Ping Pong (~60'): Switch driver and navigator on time or event. E.g. One pair partner writes the test (Test-First code!), the other implements the code to make the test pass. Switch roles.
- Session (~50) - Vampire Cells: Some cells feed off of their neighbours. See definition and example
  Session (~50) - choose one constraint from:
- No 2D structure: Don't use any arrays, lists, linked lists, strings, ...
- Cyclomatic Complexity = 1: Don't use any control structures. (No conditionals, no loops, ...)
- No mouse: Don't use the mouse the whole session! Learn your keyboard shortcuts.
  should we prepare cheatsheets for your development environments?
